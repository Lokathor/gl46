# A Generated Crate

This crate is hand-tuned output from running one of the scripts in the [phosphorus](https://github.com/Lokathor/phosphorus) repo.

Because of this, PRs to this crate about anything other than the top level crate doucmentation cannot generally be accepted.
Instead you should make changes to how `phosphorus` does its thing.

# gl46
Bindings to OpenGL 4.6 (plus some extensions)

See the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/gl46) for an explanation of the crate's operation.
